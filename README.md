# getmailrc-diaries

I have since 2008-11-09 been keeping a work diary that I share daily
with teammates via email.  This is my
[`getmail(1)`](http://pyropus.ca/software/getmail/) configuration for
fetching messages in my Diaries email folder, in addition to a custom
Perl script used as filter to save each diary entry to its own file in
plain text in my home directory.  Besides ensuring having my own copy of
the diary entries off the cloud, this also makes for convenient
grepping.
